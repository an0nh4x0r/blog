Basically when we're on a linux server it is very hard to get the actual count of the number of lines in a files ... so we can use this following command to get the numbers of lines in a file.

```
wc -l filename
```

Also if at the same time we also want the number of words in a file, then we can use the following command.

```
wc -w filename
```
